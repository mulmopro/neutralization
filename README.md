# neutralization in a circular cross-sectional Tmixer
3D solver that models neutralization reactions (in this case is meant for NaOH and HCl)
twoLiquidMixingFoamNeutralization: Please compile first Cphi class, then chemReac class and, at the end, the executable solver
testCase: please run ./Allrun (this command generates the circular cross-sectional Tmixer mesh and it runs the solver "twoLiquidMixingFoamNeutralization")
