# Neutralization in square/circular cross-sectional Tmixer
3D solver that models dilution and neutralization reactions (in this case is tailored for NaOH and HCl)

twoLiquidMixingFoamNeutralization: Please compile first "Cphi" class, then "chemReac" class and, at the end, the executable solver "twoLiquidMixingFoamNeutralization".

testCase: please run ./Allrun (this command generates the circular cross-sectional Tmixer mesh and it execute the solver "twoLiquidMixingFoamNeutralization")

# Experimental setup
The experimental setup is reported:

Two geometries (D<sub>h</sub> = 3 mm) are investigated both experimentally and numerically: the former is a square cross-sectional T-mixer (T<sub>sq</sub>), the latter is a circular cross-sectional T-mixer (T<sub>cr</sub>)
